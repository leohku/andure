DevTools for Android Chrome.

Based on [eruda](https://github.com/liriliri/eruda), **andure** uses AdGuard HTTPS filtering to dynamically inject web-based DevTools into any website, allowing for inspection and debugging similar to desktop Chromium DevTools.

To start DevTools for a website, simply shake your phone and a prompt will appear.
